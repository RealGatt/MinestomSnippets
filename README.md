# MinestomSnippets
Random snippets of code I've written up while working on Minestom projects.

This repository is filled with individual classes/snippets of code. They may or may not have explanations, and hopefully I've grouped them up.

Do not ask me for help in implementing this code into your own project. It is expected to break. Most of my code is written for a single purpose, and not for wide-spread use- so timing efficiency isn't my highest priority. It just has to *work*.
